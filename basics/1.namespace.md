### What is namespace?
- a logical container that groups related identifiers (functions, classes, variables) under a single name to avoid naming conflicts.
- It is **NOT** an object, not an instance, and not a memory-allocated structure.
- It exists purely at a compile-time to organize an qualify names.

### Relationship Between Header Files and Namespace
- A header file can contain a namespace.
- But a header file does not create a namespace by itself.
- You `#include` a header -> you copy the code inside it -> which may contain a namespace.
Example: 
```cpp
//header1.h
namespace header {
    void func();
}
```
```cpp
#include "header1.h"
header1::func();
```
Thus:
- Header file $\neq$ namespace
- Namespace is just code inside the header file
- `#include` does not create a namespace; it only brings in text that defines one

### How Namespaces Actually Work
- Namespaces only exist during compilation
- They only affect how you refer to identifiers (`std::vector`, `my::foo`, etc.).
- They do not affect memory layout or runtime behavior
- They can be reopened anywhere
```cpp
namespace mylib {
    void foo();
}
namespace mylib {
    void bar();
}
```
Everything merges into a single namespace `mylib`.

### Why use Namespaces
- To avoid collisions:
```cpp
libraryA::init();
libraryB::init();
```
- To logically group related code.
- To simplify using libraries:
```
using namespace std;
```
