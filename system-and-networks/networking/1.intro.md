### Internet
- The internet is a group of many networks that all use the **IP protocol**.
- A host is any computer connected to the network.
- Routers and switches only forward packets.(That's literally it)
- All real "intelligence" lives in the **host's protocol stack**, not int the network.

#### Packet
- **Packet = Header + Payload**
    - Header: addresses and control information 
    - Payload: the actual data
- A packet is usually about 1500 bytes, so large messages are split into many packets.

#### How Communication Works
1. Sender(p1)
    - The application creates a message.
    - The protocol stack breaks it into packets and adds headers.
    - Packets are sent out into the network.
2. Inside the Network
    - Routers read the header and forward the packet toward the destination.
    - They do not look a t the data or try to rebuild the message.
3. Receiver (P2)
    - The protocol stack receives the packets
    - Headers dre removed, packets are put back in order, and the original message is rebuilt.
    - The message is given to the application.

#### Key features of IP
- **Packet-switched network:** A message is split into many small packets.
- **Best-effort delivery:** No guarantee of delivery, order, or reliability.
- **Routing:** Each packet chooses its own path independently.

#### Protocol Stack
- **Definition: TCP/IP Stack**
    - Application: HTTP, FTP
    - Transport: TCP (reliable), UDP (connectionless)
    - Network: IO (packet forwarding)
    - Link: Ethernet, Wi-Fi

#### Why IP Needs a Protocol Stack
IP only forwards packets. It cannot solve problems like:
- Large messages (need splitting and reassembly)
- Out-of-order packets
- Lost packets
- Bit errors during transmission
- Congestion and queuing delays

-> The protocol Stack adds reliability, ordering, error recovery, and flow control at higher layers.
